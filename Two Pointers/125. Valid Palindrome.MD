### Description

> Tags: *Two Pointers, String*


A phrase is a palindrome if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward. Alphanumeric characters include letters and numbers.

Given a string `s`, return `true` if it is a palindrome, or `false` otherwise.



 
Example 1:
```
Input: s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: true
Explanation: "amanaplanacanalpanama" is a palindrome.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: s = "race a car"
Output: false
Explanation: "raceacar" is not a palindrome.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: s = " "
Output: true
Explanation: s is an empty string "" after removing non-alphanumeric characters.
Since an empty string reads the same forward and backward, it is a palindrome.
```

Constraints:
```
- `1 <= s.length <= 2*10^5`
- `s` consists only of printable ASCII characters.


```
> steps:

- firstly you have to get all alpha numeric letters in the s and store them to a variable named `string`
- after you have to initialize two pointer one of them at the beginning named `left` and other one at the end of `string` and named `right`
- after all of them you while left lower than or equal to right we check is `string[left]` and `string[right]` eqaul or not if they are not equal we have to return `false`


## CODE
```python
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, s: str) -> bool:
        string = ""
        for i in s:
            if i.isalnum():
                string += i
        left = 0 
        right = len(string) - 1
        string = string.lower()
        while left <= right:
            if string[left] != string[right]:
                return False
            left += 1
            right -= 1
        return True            
```
