### Description

> Tags: *Two Pointers, String, Dynamic Programming*


Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if `s` is a subsequence of `t`, or `false` otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"` while `"aec"` is not).




 
Example 1:
```
Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true
```
Example 2:
```
Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false
```


Constraints:
```
- `1 <= s.length <= 100`
- `0 <= t.length <= 10^4`
- `s` and `t` consist of only english lowercase letters.


```
> steps:

- Initialize a pointer `slow `to `0` to track the position in string `s`.
- If s is empty, return `True` (empty string is a subsequence of any string).
- Iterate over string `t` using a `fast` pointer.
- If the current characters in `s` and `t` at `slow` and `fast` positions match, increment `slow`.
- If `slow` equals the length of `s`, all characters in `s` have been found in `t` in order, so return `True`.
- If the loop ends and not all characters in `s` are found in `t`, return `False`.


## CODE
```python
class Solution:
    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        slow = 0
        if len(s) == 0:
            return True
        for fast in range(len(t)):
            if s[slow] == t[fast]:
                slow += 1
            if slow == len(s):
                return True
        return False          
```
