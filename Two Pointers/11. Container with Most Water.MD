### Description

> Tags: *Two Pointers, Array, Greedy*


You are given an integer array `height` of length `n`. There are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the `ith` line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.



 
Example 1:
```
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1
```


Constraints:
```
- `n == height.length`
- `2 <= n <= 10^5`
- `0 <= height[i] <= 10^4`


```
> steps:
- Initialize `l` (left pointer) to the beginning and `r` (right pointer) to the end of the `height` list.
- Use a while loop to iterate until `l` is less than `r`.
- Calculate the area using the formula `(r - l) * min(height[l], height[r])` and update the maximum area (area) accordingly.
- Move the pointers (`l` or `r`) based on the height comparison (`height[l]` versus `height[r]`) to potentially find a larger area.


## CODE
```python
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        area = 0 
        l, r = 0, len(height) - 1 
        while l < r:
            
            lh = height[l]
            rh = height[r]

            current_area = (r - l) * min(lh, rh)

            area = max(area, current_area)
 
            if lh < rh:
                l += 1 
            else:
                r -= 1 
        return area

```
