# <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-interval/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150>57. Insert Intervals</a>

### Description

> Tags: *Array, *


ou are given an array of non-overlapping intervals `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]` represent the start and the end of the `ith` interval and `intervals` is sorted in ascending order by `starti`. You are also given an interval newInterval = [start, end] that represents the start and end of another interval.

Insert `newInterval` into `intervals` such that `intervals` is still sorted in ascending order by `starti` and `intervals` still does not have any overlapping intervals (merge overlapping intervals if necessary).

Return `intervals` after the insertion.

Note that you don't need to modify `intervals` in-place. You can make a new array and return it.
 
Example 1:
```
Input: intervals = [[1,3],[6,9]], newInterval = [2,5]
Output: [[1,5],[6,9]]
```
Example 2:
```
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[3,5],[6,7],[8,10],[12,16]], newInterval = [4,8]
Output: [[1,2],[3,10],[12,16]]
Explanation: Because the new interval [4,8] overlaps with [3,5],[6,7],[8,10].

```
Constraints:
```
- `0<= intervals.length <= 10^4`
- `intervals[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= starti <= endi <= 10^5`
- `intervals` is sorted by `starti` in ascending order.
- `newInterval.length == 2`
- `0 <= start <= end <= 10^5`


```
> steps:
- append `newInterval` to `intervals` array.
- `sort` intervals by the starting value of each interval. 
- create a variable called `output` which will contain our final answer, and initialize it to the first interval in intervals. 
- Then we'll enter a loop that'll start by comaring the first two intervals:
- If the end of the first interval less than the start of the second interval, there is no overlap and we can just add the second interval to merged.
- Else then the two intervals overlap. We'll merge the intervals by comparing the ending values of both intervals, take the maximum, and make that the new end of the first interval.

## CODE
```python
class Solution:
    def insert(self, intervals: List[List[int]], newInterval: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        intervals.append(newInterval)
        intervals.sort(key = lambda i: i[0])  
        output = [intervals[0]]
        for interval in intervals[1:]:
            lastEnd = output[-1][1]
            if interval[0] <= lastEnd:
                output[-1][1] = max(lastEnd, interval[1])
            else:
                output.append(interval)
        return output            
           
         
```
