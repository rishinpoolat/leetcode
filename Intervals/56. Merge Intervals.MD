### Description

> Tags: *Array, Sorting*


Given an array of `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`, merge all overlapping intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.

 
Example 1:
```
Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlap, merge them into [1,6].
```
Example 2:
```
Input: intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]
Output: [[1,5]]
Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.

```
Constraints:
```
- `1 <= intervals.length <= 10^4`
- `intervals[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= starti <= endi <= 10^4`


```
> steps:

- first  `sort` intervals by the starting value of each interval. 
- create a variable called `output` which will contain our final answer, and initialize it to the first interval in intervals. 
- Then we'll enter a loop that'll start by comaring the first two intervals:
- If the end of the first interval less than the start of the second interval, there is no overlap and we can just add the second interval to merged.
- Else then the two intervals overlap. We'll merge the intervals by comparing the ending values of both intervals, take the maximum, and make that the new end of the first interval.

## CODE
```python
class Solution:
    def merge(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        intervals.sort(key = lambda i: i[0])  
        output = [intervals[0]]
        for interval in intervals[1:]:
            lastEnd = output[-1][1]
            if interval[0] <= lastEnd:
                output[-1][1] = max(lastEnd, interval[1])
            else:
                output.append(interval)
        return output            
         
```
