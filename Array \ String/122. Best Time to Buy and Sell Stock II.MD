### Description

> Tags: *Array , dynamic Programming, greedy*



You are given an integer array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold at most one share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the same day.

Find and return the `maximum `profit you can achieve.

 
Example 1:
```
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
Total profit is 4 + 3 = 7.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Total profit is 4.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no way to make a positive profit, so we never buy the stock to achieve the maximum profit of 0.
```

Constraints:
```
- 1 <= prices.length <= 3*10^4
- 0 <= prices[i] <= 10^4
```

> steps: greedy approach

- Set profit as `0`
- use for loop that iterates from `1` to `len(prices)`,This is because a comparison with the previous price is needed, so  
    starting from the first day would be redundant.
- check if current price is greater than previous price, if so its a possibility of profit.
- then profit += prices[i] - prices[i-1]
- return profit    

## CODE
```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        profit = 0
        for index in range(1, len(prices)):
            if prices[index] > prices[index-1]:
                profit += prices[index]-prices[index-1]
        return profit
        

```

> Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n)
  We are iterating through both arrays once, so the time complexity is O(n).
- Space complexity: O(1)
  We are not using any extra space, so the space complexity is O(1).
