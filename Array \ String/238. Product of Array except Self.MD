### Description

> Tags: *Array, Prefixsum*


- Given an integer array `nums`, return an array `answer` such that `answer[i]` is equal to the product of all the elements of `nums` except `nums[i]`.

- The product of any prefix or suffix of `nums` is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

- You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time and without using the division operation.


 
Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]

```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]
Output: [0,0,9,0,0]
```
Constraints:
```
- `2 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `-30 <= nums[i] <= 30`
- The product of any prefix or suffix of `nums` is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

```
> steps: 
- initialise result list as same length of nums array
- for loop iterates over each element of the input list nums. For each element, it updates the corresponding index in res with the product of all elements before it(prefix). This way, res[i] will contain the product of all elements to the left of nums[i].
- for loop iterates over each element of the input list nums in reverse order. For each element, it updates the corresponding index in res with the product of all elements to the right of nums[i]. This is done by multiplying the existing value in res[i] (which contains the product of elements to the left) by the product of all elements to the right.
- return res

## CODE
```python
class Solution:
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        res = [1]*len(nums)
        postfix = prefix =1
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            res[i] = prefix
            prefix *= nums[i]
        for i in range(len(nums)-1,-1,-1):
            res[i] *= postfix
            postfix *= nums[i]             
        return res
```

> Complexity
- Time complexity:O(n)
- Space complexity:O(1)
