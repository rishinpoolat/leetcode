### Description

> Tags: *String, trie*



Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

If there is no common prefix, return an empty string `""`.


 
Example 1:
```
Input: strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]
Output: "fl"

```
Example 2:
```
Input: strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]
Output: ""
Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.
```

Constraints:
```
- `1 <= strs.length <= 200`
- `0 <= strs[i].length <= 200`
- `strs[i]` will only consist english lowercase letters.

```
> steps: 
- Initialize an empty string ans to store the common prefix.
- Sort the input list v lexicographically. This step is necessary because the common prefix should be common to all the strings, so we need to find the common prefix of the first and last string in the sorted list.
- Iterate through the characters of the first and last string in the sorted list, stopping at the length of the shorter string.
- If the current character of the first string is not equal to the current character of the last string, return the common prefix found so far.
- Otherwise, append the current character to the ans string.
- Return the ans string containing the longest common prefix.




## CODE
```python
class Solution:
    def longestCommonPrefix(self, strs: List[str]) -> str:
        ans = ''
        strs = sorted(strs)
        first = strs[0]
        last = strs[-1]
        minlength = min(len(first), len(last))
        
        for i in range(minlength):
            if first[i]!=last[i]:
                return ans
            else:
                ans += first[i]  
        return ans       
          
```
