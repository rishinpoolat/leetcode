### Description

> Tags: *Array, Dynamic Programming, Greedy*



You are given an integer array `nums`. You are initially positioned at the array's first index, and each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Return `true` if you can reach the last index, or `false` otherwise.


 
Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: true
Explanation: Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [3,2,1,0,4]
Output: false
Explanation: You will always arrive at index 3 no matter what. Its maximum jump length is 0, which makes it impossible to reach the last index.
```
Constraints:
```
- `1<= nums.length <= 10^4`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`

```
> steps: two pointer approach

- We start at the last index of the array and work our way backwards.
- so we start from our goal ie the last index. and work our way towards it meaning if we can reach goal from its neighbour then it means all we need to make sure is that we can reach neighbour.
- similarly if we can reach first occurr .
- we use while loop here, starting from the last index
- check if that index + value of num at that index can reach the goal, then we can set the next goal to be the index
- return true if goal reaches to the index 0 else false. 



## CODE
```python
class Solution:
    def canJump(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        goal = len(nums) - 1
        i = len(nums) - 1
    
        while i >= 0:
            if i + nums[i] >= goal:
                goal = i
            i -= 1
    
        return True if goal == 0 else False   
```

> Complexity
- Time complexity:O(n)
- Space complexity:O(1)
