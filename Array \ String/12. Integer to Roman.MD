### Description

> Tags: *Hash table, Math, String*




 

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: `I`, `V`, `X`, `L`, `C`, `D` and `M`.

Symbol       Value
`I`             1
`V`             5
`X`             10
`L`             50
`C`             100
`D`             500
`M`             1000
For example, 2 is written as `II` in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. 12 is written as `XII`, which is simply `X + II`. The number 27 is written as `XXVII`, which is `XX` + `V + II`.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not `IIII`. Instead, the number four is written as `IV`. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as `IX`. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

- `I` can be placed before `V` (5) and `X` (10) to make 4 and 9. 
- `X` can be placed before `L` (50) and `C` (100) to make 40 and 90. 
- `C` can be placed before `D` (500) and `M` (1000) to make 400 and 900.

Given an integer, convert it to a roman numeral.

 
Example 1:
```
Input: num = 3
Output: "III"
Explanation: 3 is represented as 3 ones.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: num = 58
Output: "LVIII"
Explanation: L = 50, V = 5, III = 3.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: num = 1994
Output: "MCMXCIV"
Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.
```

```
Constraints:
```
`1 <= num <= 3999`

```

> steps: 

- Define a dictionary `roman_mapping` where keys are integers and values are their corresponding Roman numeral symbols.

- Initialize an empty string `result` to store the Roman numeral representation of the input integer.

- Iterate through the roman_mapping dictionary in descending order of keys (from 1000 to 1).

- For each key-value pair in the dictionary, while the input integer num is greater than or equal to the current key (value), append the corresponding Roman numeral symbol (symbol) to the result string and subtract the key (value) from the input integer num.

- After iterating through all key-value pairs in the dictionary, return the result string, which contains the Roman numeral representation of the input integer.

## CODE
```python
class Solution:
    def intToRoman(self, num: int) -> str:
        roman_mapping = {
            1000: 'M',
            900: 'CM',
            500: 'D',
            400: 'CD',
            100: 'C',
            90: 'XC',
            50: 'L',
            40: 'XL',
            10: 'X',
            9: 'IX',
            5: 'V',
            4: 'IV',
            1: 'I'
        }
        result = ""
        for value, symbol in roman_mapping.items():
            while num >= value:
                result += symbol
                num -= value
        return result
