### Description

> Tags: *Array, Dynamic Programming, Greedy*



You are given a `0-indexed` array of integers `nums` of length `n`. You are initially positioned at `nums[0]`.

Each element `nums[i]` represents the maximum length of a forward jump from index `i`. In other words, if you are at `nums[i]`, you can jump to any `nums[i + j]` where:

- `0 <= j <= nums[i]` and
- `i + j < n`

Return the minimum number of jumps to reach `nums[n - 1]`. The test cases are generated such that you can reach `nums[n - 1]`.



 
Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: 2
Explanation: The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2. Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [2,3,0,1,4]
Output: 2
```
Constraints:
```
- `1<= nums.length <= 10^4`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
- Its guaranteed that you can reach `nums[n-1]`

```
> steps: two pointer approach

- Initialize pointers `left` and `right` to represent the current range of indices
- Initialize the variable to count the number of jumps as `out`
- Initialize the maximum jump distance as `far`
-  Iterate through indices from left  to right
- Update the maximum jump distance(far) within the current range
- Move the left pointer to the end of the current range
- Update the right pointer to the maximum jump distance found
-  Increment the number of jumps(out)
- Return the total number of jumps(out)



## CODE
```python
class Solution:
    def jump(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        out = 0
        left = right = 0
        while right < len(nums)-1:
            far = 0
            for i in range(left, right+1):
                far= max(far,nums[i]+i)
            left = right+1
            right = far
            out+=1
        return out
```

> Complexity
- Time complexity:O(n), only iterate once through the array.
- Space complexity:O(1), We use only a constant amount of extra space for storing variables
