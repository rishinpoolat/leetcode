### Description

> Tags: *String, Two Pointers, String matching*



Given two strings `needle` and `haystack`, return the `index` of the first occurrence of `needle` in `haystack`, or `-1` if `needle`is not part of `haystack`.


 
Example 1:
```
Input: haystack = "sadbutsad", needle = "sad"
Output: 0
Explanation: "sad" occurs at index 0 and 6.
The first occurrence is at index 0, so we return 0.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: haystack = "leetcode", needle = "leeto"
Output: -1
Explanation: "leeto" did not occur in "leetcode", so we return -1.
```


Constraints:
```
- `1 <= heystack.length, needle.length <= 10^4`
- `haystack` and `needle` only have lowecase english letters.
```


## CODE
```python
class Solution(object):
    def strStr(self, haystack, needle):
        # makes sure we don't iterate through a substring that is shorter than needle
        for i in range(len(haystack) - len(needle) + 1):
            # check if any substring of haystack with the same length as needle is equal to needle
            if haystack[i : i+len(needle)] == needle:
                # if yes, we return the first index of that substring
                return i
        # if we exit the loop, return -1        
        return -1
          
```

> Complexity
- Time complexity:O((haystack.length() - needle.length() + 1) * needle.length())
- Space complexity:O(1)
