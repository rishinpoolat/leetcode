### Description

> Tags: *Array , dynamic Programming*



You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i`th day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.


 
Example 1:
```
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
```

Constraints:
```
- 1 <= prices.length <= 10^5
- 0 <= prices[i] <= 10^4
```

> steps: two pointer approach

- initialize `maxprof` and `buy` as `0`.
- initialise a for loop from second element to end of array as `sell`.
- compare difference between sell and buy as `profit`.
- if value of `price[sell]` < `price[buy]` , set buy value as sell
- set maxprof = max(profit, maxprofit)
- return `maxprof`

## CODE
```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
       buy = 0
       maxpro = 0
       for sell in range(1, len(prices)):
            profit = prices[sell]-prices[buy]
            if prices[sell] < prices[buy]:
                buy = sell
            maxpro = max(maxpro, profit)
       return maxpro     

```

> Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n)
  We are iterating through both arrays once, so the time complexity is O(n).
- Space complexity: O(1)
  We are not using any extra space, so the space complexity is O(1).
