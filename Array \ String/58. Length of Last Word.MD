### Description

> Tags: *String*



Given a string `s` consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.

A word is a maximal `substring` consisting of non-space characters only.


 
Example 1:
```
Input: s = "Hello World"
Output: 5
Explanation: The last word is "World" with length 5.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: s = "   fly me   to   the moon  "
Output: 4
Explanation: The last word is "moon" with length 4.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: s = "luffy is still joyboy"
Output: 6
Explanation: The last word is "joyboy" with length 6.
```
Constraints:
```
- `1 <= s.length <= 10^4`
- `s` consists of only English letters and spaces `' '`.
- There will be at least one word in s.

```
> steps: 

-  Strip trailing whitespaces from the input string using the strip() method.
-  Split the string into words using the split() method.
-  If there are no words after stripping whitespaces, return 0.
-  Otherwise, return the length of the last word, which is the last element in the list of words.


## CODE
```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLastWord(self, s: str) -> int:
        words = s.strip().split()
        if not words:
            return 0
        return len(words[-1])
          
```
