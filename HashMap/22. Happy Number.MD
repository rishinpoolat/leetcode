### Description

> Tags: *HashTable, Math, Two Pointers*



Write an algorithm to determine if a number `n` is happy.

A happy number is a number defined by the following process:

- Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
- Repeat the process until the number equals `1` (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include `1`.
- Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.
Return `true` if `n` is a happy number, and `false` if not.

 
Example 1:
```
Input: n = 19
Output: true
Explanation:
1^2 + 9^2 = 82
8^2 + 2^2 = 68
6^2 + 8^2 = 100
1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 = 1
```
Example 2:
```
Input: n = 2
Output: false
```
Constraints:
```
- `1 <= n <= 2^31 - 1`

```
> steps:

- firsly we get all of the digits and we get square of them after sum all of them
- subsequently we check this sum equal to 1 or a number that we before calculated is in the hashmap
- if that so we return `False` otherwise we continue to process if number can reach to `1` we return `True`



## CODE
```python
class Solution:
    def isHappy(self, n: int) -> bool:
        numbers = {}
        number = 0
        while True:
            for i in str(n):
                number += int(i)**2
            if number == 1:
                return True    
            if number in numbers:
                return False
            numbers[number] = 0
            n= number 
            number = 0 
```
