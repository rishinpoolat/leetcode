### Description

> Tags: *HashTable, Array, Union Find*


Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time.

 
Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
Output: 9
```


Constraints:
```
`0 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
`-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

```
> steps:

- duplicates in `nums` is not a problem, so we turn nums into a set.
- previous value for some value in the nums (i.e. `n - 1`, where n is in nums) doesn't exist in nums.
- now, we know we have the start of a consecutive subsequence, so we can find how long the sequence goes. 
- We can check this by seeing how many consecutive elements appear in nums (i.e. `n + 1`, where `n` is in nums).
- We will update this `length` as well as `n` as long as we see consecutive elements (i.e. `length += 1 `and `n += 1`).
- when there's no longer a consecutive element, we break out and update  
    res to the largest of the lengths of the consecutive subsequences.
- We will do this throughout the entire set



## CODE
```python
    class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nums = set(nums)
        result= 0
        for n in nums:
            if not n - 1 in nums:
                length = 1
                while (n + 1) in nums:
                    length += 1
                    n += 1
                result = max(result, length)
        return result
             
```

> Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n)
- Space complexity: O(n)
