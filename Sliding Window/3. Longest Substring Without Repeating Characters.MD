### Description

> Tags: *Hashtable, String, Sliding Window*


Given a string `s`, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.



 
Example 1:
```
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```

Constraints:
```
- `0 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `s` consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.



```
> steps:
- create a set `chars` to store unrepeated chars
- use a pointers `l` and `r` to get find length
- iterate through each character of the string and add to `chars` if not in chars, and if present remove from chars till not present.
- use `res` to store maximum length and compare value in each iteration.
- return res



## CODE
```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        chars = set()
        l = 0
        res = 0
        for r in range(len(s)):
            while s[r] in chars:
                chars.remove(s[l])
                l+=1
            chars.add(s[r])
            res = max(res, r-l+1)
        return res                    
```
