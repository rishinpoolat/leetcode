### Description

> Tags: *Array, Binary Search, Sliding Window, Prefix sum*


Given an array of positive integers `nums` and a positive integer `target`, return the minimal length of a 
subarray whose sum is greater than or equal to target. If there is no such subarray, return `0` instead.



 
Example 1:
```
Input: target = 7, nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: The subarray [4,3] has the minimal length under the problem constraint.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: target = 4, nums = [1,4,4]
Output: 1
```
Example 3:
```
Input: target = 11, nums = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]
Output: 0
```

Constraints:
```
- `1 <= target <= 10^9`
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`



```
> steps:

- We initialize two pointers, `left` and `right` pointers, both at the beginning of the array, and a variable `sum_of_subarray` to hold the sum of the current subarray, which is initially 0.
- We also initialize a variable `min_length` to len(nums)+1 which is used to keep track of the minimum length of the subarray found so far.
- For every element pointed to by the `right`, we add it to `sum_of_subarray`.
- After adding a new element to `sum_of_subarray`, we check if the sum is greater than or equal to the target. If it is, we try to shrink the subarray from the left (i.e., increment left) as long as the sum remains greater than or equal to the target, each time updating min_length if the current length of the subarray is smaller.
- The process continues until `right` has gone through every element in the array.
- If `min_length` remains same, it means no valid subarray was found, so we return 0. Otherwise, we return min_length.


## CODE
```python
class Solution:
    def minSubArrayLen(self, target: int, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        left = 0
        sum_of_subarray = 0
        min_length = len(nums)+1
        
        for right in range(len(nums)):
            sum_of_subarray += nums[right]
            
            while sum_of_subarray >= target:
                min_length = min(min_length, right - left + 1)
                sum_of_subarray -= nums[left]
                left += 1
        return 0 if min_length==len(nums)+1 else min_length               
```
